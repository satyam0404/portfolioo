# How to use
1. Create a project folder. Inside it, create folders `css`, `js`, and `assets`.
2. Copy the `index.html` content into `index.html` at the project root.
3. Save the CSS into `css/styles.css` and the JS into `js/script.js`.
4. Put your profile image as `assets/profile.jpg` and project thumbnails as `assets/project1.png`, etc. Add `assets/favicon.png` if you have one.
5. Edit the text placeholders (YOUR NAME, email, links) to your info.

# Optional improvements
- Hook up the contact form to EmailJS, Formspree, or your own server with a POST endpoint.
- Convert the projects area to fetch a JSON list of projects so you can add projects easily.
- Use optimized images (WebP) and `loading="lazy"` on images.
- Add accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation for modals (if you add project details modals).

# Hosting
- For free hosting, push the folder to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or deploy to Netlify/Vercel.
